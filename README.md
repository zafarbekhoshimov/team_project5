# Traffic Signs Detection
In this project our purpose was to build a model that can precisely detect traffic signs. 

# Data
The data for this project would be collection of road traffic signs in RGB format. The data will be trained on the dataset of traffic 
signs. The data was divided into train, test, and validation sets. 

# Model
The model for this project is developed using CNN (Convolutional Neural Network) along with the GridSearchCV. Additionally, although one 
project's models were converted into grayscale in order to ease the training process during our team project. Later, I have trained the 
other models without converting them into grayscale, although it took longer time I was pretty enthusiastic about it's results.

# Evaluation
The performance of the models is evaluated using metrics such as f1_score, precision_score, recall_score
